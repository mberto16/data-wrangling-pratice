RUN THIS BEFORE YOU START TO CLEAR ANY VARIABLES/OBJECTS FROM THE R ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH YOUR WORK IN THIS ACTIVITY.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```


This exercise is motivated by <https://anythingbutrbitrary.blogspot.com/2012/08/manipulating-data-frames-using-sqldf.html>

0.  Load any necessary libraries.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

1.  Read in the roads and crashes CSVs from the data/ folder. Call them `crash` and `road`. (These files can also be obtained at `crash`: <https://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/crashes.csv>, `road`: <https://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/roads.csv>). Explore the first few lines of each dataframe using the `head()` function.

```{r}
data_dir <- here("data//")

crash <- read_csv(paste0(data_dir, "crashes.csv"))
road <- read_csv(paste0(data_dir, "roads.csv"))
head(crash)
head(road)
```

2.  Join data to retain only complete data, (using an inner join) e.g. those observations with road lengths and districts. Merge without using `by` argument, then merge using `by = "Road"`. call the output `merged.` How many observations are there?

```{r}
merged <- inner_join(crash, road)
merged <- inner_join(crash, road, by = "Road")
dim(merged)
```

3.  Join data using a `full_join.` Call the output `full.` How many observations are there?

```{r}
full <- full_join(crash, road)
nrow(full)
```

4.  Do a left join of the `road` and `crash`. ORDER matters here! How many observations are there?

```{r}
left <- left_join(road, crash)
nrow(left)
```

5.  Repeat above with a `right_join` with the same order of the arguments. How many observations are there?

```{r}
right <- right_join(road, crash)
nrow(right)
```
