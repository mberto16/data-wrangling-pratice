RUN THIS BEFORE YOU START TO CLEAR ANY VARIABLES/OBJECTS FROM THE R ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH YOUR WORK IN THIS ACTIVITY.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```


This exercise is motivated by <https://anythingbutrbitrary.blogspot.com/2012/08/manipulating-data-frames-using-sqldf.html>

0. Load any necessary libraries.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


1.  Read in the roads and crashes CSVs from the data/ folder. Call them `crash` and `road`. (These files can also be obtained at `crash`: <https://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/crashes.csv>, `road`: <https://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/roads.csv>). Explore the first few lines of each dataframe using the `head()` function. 

```{r}
data_dir <- here("data//") 
# to create a string variable that contains the directory path to 
# the data/ subdirectory on your computer. R will interpret the double
# backslash after "data" as a single backslash when it creates the string

crash <- read_csv(paste0(data_dir, "crashes.csv"))

head(crash)
# need to do the same for road
# head(road)
```

2.  Join data to retain only complete data, (using an inner join) e.g. those observations with road lengths and districts. Merge without using `by` argument, then merge using `by = "Road"`. call the output `merged.` How many observations are there?

```{r}

```

3.  Join data using a `full_join.` Call the output `full.` How many observations are there?

```{r}

```

4.  Do a left join of the `road` and `crash`. ORDER matters here! How many observations are there?

```{r}

```

5.  Repeat above with a `right_join` with the same order of the arguments. How many observations are there?

```{r}

```
