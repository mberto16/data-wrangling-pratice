RUN THIS BEFORE YOU START TO CLEAR ANY VARIABLES/OBJECTS FROM THE R ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD INTERFERE WITH YOUR WORK IN THIS ACTIVITY.
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```


```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(naniar)
library(visdat)
```

1. This lab uses the the Charm City Circulator Dataset, the same data set from Lab 2. Use `here()` and `read_csv()` to load the data set into the `circ` R object.
```{r}

```

2. Print the number of rows of `circ`
```{r}

```


3. Visualize the missing data patterns of `circ` with `vis_miss`:
```{r}

```

4. Determine the percent missing in each column using `miss_var_summary`

```{r}

```

5. Determine the number missing in each column using `gg_miss_var`:
```{r}

```


6. Write out `circ` to a file called "Circulator.csv" using `write_csv`:
```{r}

```


7. Write out `circ` to a file called "Circulator.rds" using `write_rds`:

```{r}

```
